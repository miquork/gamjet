HOW TO RUN on Hefaistos:
------------------------
(try mosh to not drop connection)
- from local: 'rsync -rutP GamHistosFill.C GamHistosFill.h Hefaistos:/media/storage/gamjet/'
[- source /work/data/root/bin/thisroot.sh]
- source /work/data/rootbinaries/root/bin/thisroot.sh
- (rm *.d *.so *.pcm)
- root -l -b -q mk_CondFormats.C
- #define GPU in mk_GamHistosFill.C
=> edit (version, IOV_list) and execute 'python runAllIOVs.py'
[- nohup root -l -b -q mk_GamHistosFill.C > log.txt & ]
+ runtime about 12h, up from 9h (v19: 09:24 -> 21:18 18D2)
=> edit (version, IOV_list) and execute 'python renameAllIOVs.py'

+ tail -f log.txt
+ starting up takes quite a bit (~100 sec) due to GetEntries() call
   => code TStopWatch to ignore this startup time, or skip GetEntries
      (1M entries is just 0.1% ?! => 1.39B entries, about 3.4h runtime)

Local analysis:
- rsync -rutP files from Hefaistos
[  - rename GamHistosFill_mc_2016*APV to mc_2016APV* (automatize later)]
- python addAllIOVs.py
[- root -l -b GamHistosMix.C+g]
- root -l -b GamHistosRatio.C+g

Extra plotting
- root -l -b -q drawPhotonJetVsPtVsIOV.C

CHANGELOG (latest first):
----------------------------
To-do later: add MET filters back (pass_filt). Find corrupt data at eta,gamma=0

v23(patch3) - Fix MC weighing for MadGraph QCD and add it
v24(patch1,2) - Add is22v10 to apply phoj patch to only 2022 prompt data and MC in v10/v11, not to new 2022CDE re-reco samples (NanoV12).
v24 - Fix fixedGridRho->fixedGridRhoFastjetAll, add safety for NaN. Add versioning to files. Sync JEC to Mikel (L2Relative only). Update 2022D, 2022E file lists to 22Sep2023 partial re-reco

v23 - Fix rawmet to use RawPuppiMET. Patch rawgam in PuppiJet in 2022 data and MC for phoj0 (MET ok). Return pass_leak. Add re-JEC + pdjes (DeltaJES). Add Gamjet2 folder (doGamJet2). Extend h2gametaphi to EC, although may not help with just 110EB trigger active. Remove h2gametaphi3,4 as redundant.

v22 - Switch HLT_Photon20 off for Run3. Switch 1% scaling to gain1 off for 22-23. Switch footprint correction off for 22-23. Switch off L1RC (corrl1rc was for AK4PFchs). Todo: override 75m,90m with 50m for 2023C. Override 50m with 30t for others. Next round: determine footprint from control/pphoj0.

v21e - Bybass data trigger to check trigger menu
v21 - Start implementing Run3. Add new JSON files. Add new jetvetomaps. Add new L1RC (and switch it off). Add new triggers. Disable _pu and PU reweighing for 22-23 (temporarily). Disable pass_leak and pass_filt for 22-23 (temporarily). Add code for MadGraph HT bins from dijet and add G-4Jet xsec.
=> HLT_Photon20 often missing, lots of errors on it

v20a - Rename 2016QCDAPV and 2016P8APV to 2016APVQCD and 2016APVP8
v20 - add pileup and PS reweighing for MC and lumi normalization for data
19f - comment out branches not available for 2017QCD => fixed in v20
19f - UL2017QCD files re-updated Dec 7
19f - add 'rho' in flavor, reset genjet and genjet2 for every event, require iGenJet!=-1 for 'rjet' and 'gjet', safety vs gen match to both recjet1 and recjet2
19f - add 'Rho_CHS' into BasicHistos
19f - add 'hgamtrg' with 'hgam' bins: wider bins and higher pt than 'hgamtrig'
v19e - add separate "ud" and "s" in 'flavor' folder in addition to "q"
v19d - change QCD photon match 'hasorig' from dR<0.4 to dR<0.2
v19c - add windowing for prgamqcd2, pfakeqcd2 to [0.8,1.1]
v19b - Add pfakeqcd, prgamqcd, h2rgamqcd to better estimate QCD bkg. Expect x5.5 drop in fake rate and fake photon scale close to unity
v19 - Add PF composition variables (+6). Add folder 'pf' with 1D composition and 2D response+composition. Fix missing |eta,gamma|<1.3 cut. Add DB(=MPF1).
v19x - Scale UE correction by jet aread (~0.5). Remove UE from phoj. Fix nFilesMax from 8 to 100 for MC in mk_GamHistosFill (had up to 24).
v18 - Remove UE from QCD gam and fox. Rerun everything to get data mu's fixed
v17 - Add QCD bkg, back to medium b-jet ID, gain1 to 1.01 (from 1.02)
v16 - Change b-jet ID to medium to match ttbar analysis. Extra 2D with yet finer phi granularity
=> reduce gain1 by 1% on-line (now 2%)
v15 - Add flavor breakup for data and MC. Runtime now 9.1h, compared to  6.7h in v12
v14 - Add missing pileup file, extra photon 2D with finer phi granularity. Photon 2D map to use any active triggers
v13 - Extra plots on gains, non-zero suppressed footprint plots.
v12 - Cut leak<0.06*ptgam, add 2D plots of H/E and R9 vs pTgam
v11 - add R9>0.94 cuts to avoid steps between triggers and data/MC difference; add eeBadScFilter for MC; remove ecalBadCalibFilter from UL16; implement jet veto also with 2016, 2017 maps
    => R9vsPt huge improvement, H/E similar (still 2018 step), Leakage improved at pT<60 GeV
    => MPF down by ~0.5% overall, MPF1 also at 200-300 GeV, MPFn slightly down (MC up), MPFu quite stable
v8 - extending to 2016 and 2018 data =>
read privileges missing on some files
missing Photon_eCorr on some files?
missing HLT_Photon20, 33, 200, 100EBTight, 110EBTight, 120EBtight, 
v7 - add ecalBadCalibFilter (+reweight MC pileup), back to old pT binning
v6 - reoptimized trigger selection and pT binnig
v5 - rerun of v4 since update failed
v4 - add hotjets veto
v3 - add JSON filter
v2 - add MET filters
v1 - initial version, keeping all events from EGamma for controls

[2018] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_og1_J6Hp4uALUg-R4Hkq3CF0VN6IK5komHPHv5R-o/edit?usp=sharing

TO-DO LIST
-----------
- Complete implementation of PU reweighing. Add PU variations (systematic)
- Implement JER SF (once pT-dependent?). Add JER SF variations (systematic)
- Add parton shower weights (systematic)
- Add flavor corrections and its variations (systematic)


-- Correctgamscale seems critical for photon+jet. At low pT we probably don't have pT,e ~ pT,Z/2 anymore, and low pT photons may require more correction like high pT ones (quadratic shape with minimum at pT,Z~40 GeV). Should also calibrate with superclusters instead of electrons (track+EM more like track at low pT?)
** add veto on bad photon regions?

TBD:
- Investigate 1.5% leakage at high pT, photon vs PFphoton inconsistent? (h2phoj)
  - Could explain MPF lower than MPF1. Leakage also higher in data
- Add cut on maximum leakage at low pT to reduce QCD bkg? (h2phoj in data,MC)
  - do data/MC ratio of normalized leakage in pT bins 
- Investigate non-continuous H/E vs pT
- Veto photons near ECAL holes? And near SC boundaries? (h2gametaphi1,2)
  => at least ECAL holes, some missing from MC

tbd
- fix prhovsmu for data_Run2 => missing pileup_ASCII file from GPU machine?

tbd
+ reweight MC pileup (brilcalc for target profiles)
+ add JER SF

Plan:
- fix running over 2018A so get complete sample => done
  - increased nPhotonMax to 200, crashed with one event having 191
- implement JSON, rerun v3
  - /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions18/13TeV/Legacy_2018/Cert_314472-325175_13TeV_Legacy2018_Collisions18_JSON.txt

- implement hotzones, rerun v4,v5
- implement JER SF, rerun v6 (MC only?)

To-do list:
- Check that runs on data => done
- Implement merging of 2018A,B,C,D => hadd (but in the future, give data luminosity weight for correct averaging?)
- Implement data/MC ratio => ok
- Run on full 2018 data and MC (flat?) => v1 ok, v2 on-going
- Implement photon corrections and uncertainties
   => 2018 MPFdata bit low, bal less different => photon footprint?
   - Look into photon jet minus photon minus L1RC. Separate CHF, NEF, NHF
- Jet and MET smearing? => careful, check shift on jet scales
- Rho vs pT mu etc.
- Select exactly one photon? => make plot of these vs pTgamma
- MET cleaning => done; add control plot
- Study photon seedGain vs pT, energyErr vs pT, hoe vs pT, r9 vs pT
- Check photon eta-phi distribution to locate hot/cold zones => draft, update
- Compare to Higgs to gamma gamma workflow

Lucas Torterotot, latest talk on gamma+jet I could find (29 July 2019, EOY18):
- https://indico.cern.ch/event/837707/#10-gamma-jet-l3res-for-2018-v1
Code through Stephanie:
- https://github.com/lucastorterotot/DijetRootTreeMaker/blob/master/instructions/GammaJetTree_Instruction.md

Latest runs v2, v3 (trig+JSON; all in parallel, except 2018a in v2 and MC in v3)
- 2018A: runtime 3453 sec. => 6387 s (alone) / 9307 s (~14/fb)
- 2018B: runtime 5169 sec. => 6167 s / 6262 s (~7.1/fb)
- 2018C: runtime 5110 sec. => 6102 s / 6217 s (~6.9/fb)
- 2018D: runtime 14631 sec. => 14834 s / 16220 s (~31/fb)
- 2018MC: runtime 1075 sec. => 910 s / 452 s (alone)
=> would be justified to split 2018D in two to go from 4.1h to 2.1h

Sami's code:
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/slehti/ZbAnalysis/-/blob/master/src/Analysis.h
  - return false; for event selection
- https://gitlab.cern.ch/slehti/ZbAnalysis/-/blob/master/analyse.py
  - inputList = ROOT.TList() kommunikoi C++:aan

Observations:
- bit trick to compile and run on Hefaistos, differet ROOT version?
- HLT_Photon[100,110,120]EB_TightID_TightIso correspond to a lot of statistics in midrange, but are apparently not active in all of 2018 data => anything replacing them?
- can remove HLT_Photon100EBHE10, HLT_Photon100EEHE10, HLT_Photon100EE_TightID_TightIso also, not always active and not used at the moment
- data has 1.4B events, takes a lot of time to run (16.6h). Photon triggers are only a fraction of this. As a quick fix, activate trigger pre-selection for data
- first run took 51326 sec (14.5h), crashed before starting MC, but writing file succeeded (or not?)
- HLT_PhotonXX pass through some noise at 200 GeV that 110T does not?
